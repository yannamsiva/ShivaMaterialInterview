1) Develop a program, that accepts a deposit amount and calculates amount of interest the deposit amount earns in an year. The bank pays a flat 4% for deposits of up to Rs.1000, a flat 4.5% per year for deposits of up to Rs.5000, and a flat 5% for deposits of more than Rs.5000.
2)
Develop the program, which accepts the gross pay and produces the amount of tax owed. For a gross pay of $240 or less, the tax is 0%; for over $. 240 and $. 480 or less, the tax rate is 15%; and for any pay over $480, the tax rate is 28%.

3)

Some credit card companies pay back a small portion of the charges a customer makes over a year. A particular credit card company's pay back policy is as follows:
1.0.25% for charges up to Rs. 500.
2.0.50% for the next Rs.1000 (that is, the portion between Rs. 500 and Rs. 1500),
3.0.75% for the next Rs.1000 (that is, the portion between Rs. 1500 and Rs. 2500),
4.1.0% for charges above Rs2500.
Thus, a customer who charges Rs. 400 a year receives Rs.1.00, which is 0.25  1/100  400, and one who charges Rs1, 400 a year receives Rs. 5.75, which is 1.25 = 0.25  1/100  500 for the first Rs. 500 and 0.50  1/100  900 = 4.50 for the next Rs. 900. Determine by hand the pay backs amount for a customer who charged Rs. 2000 and one who charged Rs. 2600.
Define the program, which accepts a charge amount and computes the corresponding pay back amount.

4)

Implement a method that returns the day of the week for a given day (1..31), month (1..12) and year.
The day of the week of dates between March 1900 and February 2100 can be calculated as follows:
1.Calculate the total number of days from 1900/1/1 to the given date (see below, for details).
2.Divide this number by 7, the remainder is the day of the week (0 - sunday, 1 - monday, etc)
To calculate the total number of days:
1.Subtract 1900 from the given year and multiply the result by 365. Add the missing leaps years by adding (year - 1900) / 4.
2.If the given year is a leap year and the month is January or February, subtract 1 from the previous result.
3.Add no of days of the given year till the given month (in case of February always add 28, because the additional day for a leap year would have been already added).
